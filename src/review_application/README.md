I made this mini program to practice basic Java.  
what I wanted to implement: 
* interface or abstract class
* inheritance
* Calendar
* Overriding

`Review Application` is the first program I've ever made by myself.  
feel like the program is getting smaller than I planned as I started to make it. At first, I planed to make the users possible to edit all of the fields of a review by `4. 후기수정` but I failed since the class types of review objects are different (FrontEnd_class or BackEnd_class) which made it almost impossible or too complicated for me to implement what I thought. So I had to make `4.후기수정` only able to edit comment field. I know it is far from solving existing problems(I heard that a program is to solve problems) or something but I think it is just enough for me who just learned basic Java syntax. I will keep learning.
